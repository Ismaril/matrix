# Aim of the project
Project created just for fun.

# Process
Fill an array with random characters. This array will represent the 2D matrix. 
Then select random columns and start coloring the characters. Once a column is chosen,
leading color is applied to the first character of the column. 
Then, the next character in the column is colored with a trailing color. Continue in loop
and move the coloring always by one row down to create a "falling" effect.

# Status of the project
Functional

# Limitations
Requires some optimization in case of larger matrices.
Refactoring is needed to make it more readable.
Documentation is missing.
